# [Twitchtv-Bots-List](https://github.com/arrowgent/Twitchtv-Bots-List/blob/main/list.txt)
a [list](https://github.com/arrowgent/Twitchtv-Bots-List/blob/main/list.txt) of (unwanted) known twitch bots that lurk in every channel...

![atenbot](https://github.com/arrowgent/Twitchtv-Bots-List/blob/main/aten_bot.png)

## definition of a lurker bot:
* a viewer on the viewer list that --
* is not following
* has hundreds of followers
* was created several days ago
* has never streamed before
* appears in multiple channels at the same time
* ![bot](https://github.com/arrowgent/Twitchtv-Bots-List/blob/main/easybot1.png)


## why a list of bots is useful:
* banning bots --
* removal of unwanted bots because of "spying" or data collection
* removal of unwanted bots so they are not "gifted" a subscription from "gift bombs"
* viewer list cleanup: "1 viewer", but 10 bots in viewer list..


## method of detection:
* using **CHATTY** --
* click on username to see if following current channel
* if not following, then
* look at follower count & creation date
* if more than ~20-40 followers check if title & category is set
* if has followers then verify has streamed before
* **twitch-dl** videos username
* **twitch-dl** clips username
* if none exist then check username account on twitch.tv or other tools (**streamlink-twitch-gui**)
* if no profile picture or offline screen
* lastly, check other low (1) viewer channels if this bot (user) appears there simultaneously


## purpose of this list:
* informative


## missing bots user does not exist:
* hopefully twitch removes bots occasionally.  while updating this list i noticed several are missing.  good.


## issues are open:
* if you want to add suggestions for potential bots
* if you believe you are NOT a bot, we can verify that
* however if you claim NOT to be a bot, you should remove yourself from lurking in HUNDREDS or THOUSANDS of channels simultaneously (definition)
